yUML for Sublime Text
=====================

Makes using [yUML](http://yuml.me/) from Sublime Text easier. Making two great tools better by making them work together.

Sublime Text 2 and 3 on all platforms should be supported.


Features
========

There are currently only two (2) features, but they're the features you want.

* Syntax highlighting for *.yuml files.

* Open image for diagram in browser.

Install with Package Control
============================

Please use [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/). You'll be happier that way unless you plan on hacking on the code.

1. Package Control: Install Package
2. Install "yUML"
